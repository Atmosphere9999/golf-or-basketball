Simple one page/one input design using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript with an assets and favicon.ico folder. 
Type whatever you want in the search field and it will determine what the title says using constants and event listeners etc.
This was one of my first projects in IS-40B focusing on JavaScript after learning HTML5 & CSS3 the previous course.
